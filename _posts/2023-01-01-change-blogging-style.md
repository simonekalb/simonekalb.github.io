It's been a while since I don't blog on this page and everytime I start a new year I promise to myself to blog regularly, but life always takes all the space I need for blogging, and moreover, sitting in front of a screen after eight hours a day programming is not very helpful for my mental health. But I actually love to type and write, I did almost regularly in previous years.
This year I'm going to focus on some small, fast and (to me) interesting topics for the upcoming year.
Here's some of the trending topics I want to share with you:

* Move my everyday tools from GUI to TUI tools (eg. Nvim for text, h-ledger for accounting, Pine/Mutt for e-mail client)
* Move all my cloud services to selfhosted services (first of all this blog and move to a new engine which is not Jekyll)
* Restore all my consoles and computer to a functioning state (as soon as I move to new home)
* Reduce the number of closed source apps in my smartphone and compile most of them and install it from my Mac
* Share more activities online with the right tools (Mastodon, Peertube, etc.)
* Close remove uneccessary subscription
* Travel more

As I move to older age, I feel the need to share more online, contribute more to the community of programmer, thinkerers, hackers.
I'm going to start with a simple new workflow:
I'm going to create a new (private for now) repository in which I share all my day by day activities at a given date in [joplin](https://www.joplinapp.org) (my todo editor of choice) and export them into a single Mardown file for each day and then create a day by day agenda in which I share with myself all the achievements and todo things I need to accomplish.

I know it's trivial but on top of that I'm studying a simple way to selfhost an instance of [OpenProject](https://www.openproject.org) and create a series of Scrum project to handle each important phases of my life (housekeeping, finances, family, travel, personal projects) and share it with community as much as I can.

I'm very excited about this new workflow and I would like to keep it as productive as I can. I'll update it in order to share my achievements on this blog.
