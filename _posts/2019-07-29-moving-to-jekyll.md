And finally I managed to move some of blog posts to Jekyll. 
I finally mapped a first level web domain to this blog. 
So from now on you can reach me at [simonekalb.me](http://simonekalb.me).

My previous website is goin' to be still available at [old.simonekalb.me](http://old.simonekalb.me), as soon I can figure out how to access to my old hosting provider since they changed all web interfaces without notices.

I tried to compile a short list of my next articles inspired by this not-so-easy switch from Wordpress to  a Jekyll-based installation that could be useful for some of you out there:
  
  * [Installing a Jekyll Test Environment on Debian 9 (WLS)]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2019-07-29-setup-environment-ruby-and-jekyll.md %})
  * Manage a Windows/Linux/macOS test environment for Jekyll
  * I do I update pages on Jekyll and hopefully install custom themes
  
Then in the last few months I tried to move away as far as possible from cloud solutions I can't control.

So the next moves are:
  
  * Install a Bitwarden hosted solution to manage my passwords (in lieu of Google Password Sync)
  * Move away from Google Chrome and Firefox (yes, I hate Firefox as well) and use Waterfox+Bitwarden
  * Move away from VSCode/Atom/Brackets/Sublime and embrace Vim+TMux
  * Build post-installation scripts for Windows (and share it) 
  * Build post-installation scripts for macOS (and share it) 
  * Build post-installation scripts for Arch Linux/Debian (and share it) 
  * Build a triple-boot computer from scratch
  * Share command line setup between OSes via git repository
  * Build software from sources rather than download precompiled executables

I would like to continue to keep updated a new retrocomputing/retrogaming section I planned for long time but I didn't have time and dedication to make it happen in the past. 

Next articles should be:

  * Restore a broken OnePlus One with Linage and Retroarch for perfect portability
  * PSVita TV as Retrocomputing device 
  * NES/SNES/PSOne Classic best mods
  * From trash to treasure series
  * Commodore CDTV review
  * Amiga 500 restoration and modding
  * Build a retrocomputer straight from the past
  * Build an archive of retrocomputer/retrogames collection from scratch


Hopefully I would like to keep a schedule of next talk I goin' to prepare on following topics:

  * Measuring performances of a full stack project made for fun (BE, Mobile)
  * Using Java as a static language for fun and profit
  * Goin' selfhosted to survive data branches
  * Goin' minimalist to save money and the environment
  * Measure your house electricity expenses with Free Software
  * Don't call it Open Source if it's Free Software (or "How corporations change meaning to things to control it")

If you like to follow me I would like to set up an RSS feed (although is a bit outdated).
Thanks for reading it and will catch you in the near future.
